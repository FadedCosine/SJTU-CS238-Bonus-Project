In this bonus project, we deal with a well-known dataset: the iris dataset (wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).
We visualize the 3D data containing sepal's length, sepal's width, petal's width using a 3D scatter diagram.
Different colors in the 3D catter diagram represent different kinds of iris flower.
For VR instructions, player can use the pointers of both controllers to select the data point.
Once the pointer light hit the data point, the Information board will appear to display the detail data of the point.
Once the pointer light exit the date point, the board will disappear.
Player can move by right touchpad or left touchpad's teleport. 
In addition, player can move and rotate in all the directions by dragging with both controllers' grip button pressed.
Player can scale the 3D catter diagram by changing the distance with two controller with both controllers' trigger button pressed.
